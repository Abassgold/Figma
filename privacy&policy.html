                Our subsidiaries, related businesses, and other third parties that help us offer you current and prospective future services or for other lawful purposes are given access to your personal information (subject to appropriate confidentiality agreements and our instructions consistent with this privacy notice).

We may also employ third-party services to collect this data. The pages you view, the links you click, whether you read emails or click the links inside of them, whether you access the Website from various devices, and other behaviors are all examples of the information we get about how you use our Website. To analyze website traffic and usage trends and learn more about our users' demographics, we may gather analytics data or use third-party analytics tools like Google Analytics.
